# E-commerce Category Classifier

This project is an e-commerce text classification system built using a BERT-based model. It classifies product descriptions into predefined categories to enhance the organization and searchability of products.

## Overview

The E-commerce Category Classifier leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to classify product descriptions into various categories. This helps in organizing products efficiently, making it easier for users to find what they are looking for.

## Features

- **Accurate Classification**: Utilizes a fine-tuned BERT model for high accuracy.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating with existing e-commerce platforms.
- **Scalable**: Can handle a large number of product descriptions efficiently.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different e-commerce platforms and categories.
